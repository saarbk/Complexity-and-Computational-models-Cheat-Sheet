## Topics covered
The cheat sheet covers the following topics:

- P vs. NP

- Automata (deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines)

- BPP and BQP

- Turing machines (definitions, properties, and examples)

- Rice's theorem and its proof

- Regular expressions (definitions and properties)

- NP-completeness and reductions

- Time and space complexity classes (P, NP, and others)

- Complexity hierarchies (the polynomial hierarchy and the exponential hierarchy)

- Hardness and completeness

# How to use the cheat sheet
The cheat sheet is designed to be used as a reference guide for students and researchers who are studying computational models and complexity. It can be used to quickly look up definitions, properties, and examples for exersice.

To use the cheat sheet, simply download the PDF file or the LaTeX code, and refer to it as needed. The cheat sheet is organized by topic, and each topic is explained in a concise and easy-to-understand manner. The cheat sheet also comes in a two pager format that may come with you to the final exam.
